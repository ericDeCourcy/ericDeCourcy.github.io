This is the frontend code for the Fuse Stable Swap MVP. Currently we're doing a "fake" token pool, which is what this frontend hooks up to.

The frontend is hosted at https://ericdecourcy.github.io/

**DONT WORRY! The site will get better**. Much better. We're currently working on CSS restyling and improving the code that interfaces with the backend. So it will get prettier and have better instructions. Please pardon our mess.
