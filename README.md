This is the frontend code for the Fuse Stable Swap MVP. Currently we're doing a "fake" token pool, which is what this frontend hooks up to.

The frontend is hosted at https://ericdecourcy.github.io/

**DONT WORRY! The site will get better**. Much better. We're currently working on CSS restyling and improving the code that interfaces with the backend. So it will get prettier and have better instructions. Please pardon our mess.

If you want to see what the site will look like, check out the "alannas-refactor" branch
